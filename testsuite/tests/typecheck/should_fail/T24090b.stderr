T24090b.hs:9:19: error: [GHC-16382] [-Wimplicit-rhs-quantification (in -Wcompat), Werror=implicit-rhs-quantification]
    The variable ‘a’ occurs free on the RHS of the type declaration
    In the future GHC will no longer implicitly quantify over such variables
    Suggested fix: Bind ‘a’ on the LHS of the type declaration

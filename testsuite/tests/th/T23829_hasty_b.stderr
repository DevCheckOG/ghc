T23829_hasty_b.hs:8:42: error: [GHC-28914]
    • Level error: ‘ty’ is bound at level 1 but used at level 0
      Hint: quoting [t| ty |] or an enclosing expression
      would allow the quotation to be used at an earlier level
    • In the untyped splice: $ty
      In the Template Haskell quotation:
        [t| forall (ty :: TypeQ). Proxy $ty |]

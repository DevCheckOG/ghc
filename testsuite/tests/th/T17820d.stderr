T17820d.hs:6:38: error: [GHC-28914]
    • Level error: ‘foo’ is bound at level 1 but used at level 0
      Hint: quoting [| foo |] or an enclosing expression
      would allow the quotation to be used at an earlier level
    • In the untyped splice: $(const [| 0 |] foo)
      In the Template Haskell quotation:
        [d| data D = MkD {foo :: Int}
            blargh = $(const [| 0 |] foo) |]

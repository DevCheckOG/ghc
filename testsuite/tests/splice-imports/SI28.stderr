SI28.hs:8:13: error: [GHC-28914]
    • Level error: ‘id’ is bound at level 1 but used at level 0
      Hint: quoting [| id |] or an enclosing expression
      would allow the quotation to be used at an earlier level
      From imports {imported from ‘Prelude’ at 1 at SI28.hs:6:1-20}
    • In the Template Haskell quotation: [| id |]
      In the untyped splice: $([| id |])

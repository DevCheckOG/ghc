SI03.hs:10:11: error: [GHC-28914]
    • Level error: ‘sid’ is bound at level 0 but used at level -1
      Hint: quoting [| sid |] or an enclosing expression
      would allow the quotation to be used at an earlier level
      From imports {imported from ‘SI01A’ at SI03.hs:5:1-12}
    • In the untyped splice: $(sid [| pure () |])
